## :rocket: Introduction
This project contains the official PyTorch implementation, pre-trained models, fine-tuning code, and detect demo for ETETMO.

* An end-to-end intelligent visual surveillance framework,ETETMO, is proposed for robust tracking of moving objects on the airport surface.

* ETETMO replaces the traditional manually designed ID association methods with a learnable ID classification strategy.

* ETETMO surpasses state-of-theart methods across five key evaluation metrics, achieving a 7.6% improvement in HOTA and an 11% improvement in IDF1.
